Flappy Bird Java Game
Welcome to my Flappy Bird-inspired game built entirely in Java using the Swing library for graphics and user interaction. This project recreates the classic gameplay where the player controls a bird navigating through gaps in moving pipes by pressing the spacebar to keep the bird airborne.

The game features:

Smooth Gameplay: A continuous game loop runs at 60 FPS, ensuring smooth animations and fluid controls.
Random Pipe Generation: Pipes are generated at random vertical positions, making the game challenging and unpredictable with each playthrough.
Gravity and Physics: The bird is affected by gravity and can flap upward by pressing the spacebar. The game ends if the bird hits the ground or a pipe.
Score Tracking: The score increases as the bird successfully navigates through pipes, and the score is displayed at the top of the screen.
Game Reset: Once the game ends, the player can restart by pressing the spacebar.
This project was developed as a fun way to practice Java and GUI programming. The entire game logic, from collision detection to random object placement, is handled within the code, making it a great example of an object-oriented approach to game development.

Feel free to explore the code, and enjoy the game!
